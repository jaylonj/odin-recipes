    <h1>Lemon Pepper Wings</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yet another great variation on the ever-popular tailgating and sports-bar snack and very simple and easy to make. I have tried this with several brands of lemon pepper seasonings and found I actually liked the cheapest one the most. It was a tad twangier than the others and was more suited to my liking. I found it at my local food store in the seasoning section. I also tend to lean towards a lemon pepper seasoning that includes a white pepper and less black.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups peanut oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li> 
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon pepper seasoning</li>
      <li>6 pearl onions</li>
      <li>16 chicken wings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Whisk butter and lemon pepper seasoning together in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Place onions in the preheated oil and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard onions.</li>
      <li>Working in batches, cook wings in oil until crispy on the outside and cooked through, about 8 minutes. Remove wings to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
      <li>Toss wings with lemon pepper mixture until completely coated. Return to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess liquid.</li>
    </ol>
